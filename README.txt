How to Run: (must be done in this order assuming you have the necessary things installed)

Start the node file in one terminal
    do node *insert the file path*

Start the server (in a seperate terminal)
    do http-server *insert file path to front end folder*
 
 Connect to the server 
    when you have started the server it will give you a local address that it is hosted on, it will likely be   http://127.0.0.1:8080
